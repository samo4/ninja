# Asset Tracker Template

The Asset Tracker Template is a modular framework for developing IoT applications on nRF91-based devices. It is built on the [nRF Connect SDK](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-software/nRF-Connect-SDK) and [Zephyr RTOS](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/), and provides a modular, event-driven architecture suitable for battery-powered IoT use cases. The framework supports features such as cloud connectivity, location tracking, and sensor data collection.

The system is organized into modules, each responsible for a specific functionality, such as managing network connectivity, handling cloud communication, or collecting environmental data. Modules communicate through [zbus](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ncs-latest/page/zephyr/services/zbus/index.html) channels, ensuring loose coupling and maintainability.

**Supported hardware**:

* [Thingy:91 X](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/Nordic-Thingy-91-X)
* [nRF9151 DK](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/nRF9151-DK)

If you are new to nRF91 series and cellular IoT, consider taking the [Nordic Developer Academy Cellular Fundamentals Course](https://academy.nordicsemi.com/courses/cellular-iot-fundamentals).

## Get started

To set up your development environment, build the application, flash it to your device, and connect it to [nRF Cloud](https://nrfcloud.com), follow the [Getting Started](common/getting_started.md) guide.

## System Overview

![System overview](images/system_overview.svg)

Core modules include:

* **[Main](modules/main.md)**: Implements the business logic and controls the overall application behavior.
* **[Storage](modules/storage.md)**: Stores data from enabled modules.
* **[Network](modules/network.md)**: Manages LTE connectivity and tracks network status.
* **[Cloud](modules/cloud.md)**: Handles communication with nRF Cloud using CoAP.
* **[Location](modules/location.md)**: Provides location services using GNSS, Wi-Fi, and cellular positioning.
* **[Button](modules/button.md)**: Reports button press events for user input.
* **[FOTA](modules/fota_module.md)**: Manages firmware over-the-air updates.

Thingy:91 X specific modules:

* **[Environmental](modules/environmental.md)**: Collects environmental sensor data (temperature, humidity, pressure).
* **[LED](modules/led.md)**: Controls an RGB LED for visual indication.
* **[Power](modules/power.md)**: Monitors battery status and provides power management.
* **[UART Power Control](modules/uart_power_control.md)**: UART suspend/resume on VBUS changes.

### Key Features

* **State Machine Framework (SMF)**: Predictable behavior with run-to-completion model
* **Message-Based Communication**: Loose coupling via [zbus](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ncs-latest/page/zephyr/services/zbus/index.html) channels
* **Modular Architecture**: Separation of concerns with dedicated threads for blocking operations
* **Power Optimization**: LTE PSM enabled by default with configurable power-saving features
