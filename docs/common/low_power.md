# Achieving low power

This section provides an overview of how to achieve low power consumption with the Asset Tracker Template application. It covers fundamental concepts, measurement tools, configuration options, and best practices for optimizing battery life in cellular IoT applications.

## Prerequisites

If you are not familiar with cellular IoT fundamentals and low-power concepts, it is highly recommended to first complete the [Cellular IoT Fundamentals Developer Academy Course](https://academy.nordicsemi.com/courses/cellular-iot-fundamentals/). This course covers essential topics including:

- LTE-M and NB-IoT network technologies basics
- Power saving modes (PSM, eDRX)

It is also recommended to read the [Best Practices for Cellular Development](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/nwp_044/page/WP/nwp_044/intro.html) documentation.

## Measuring power consumption

The following Power Profiling tools are recommended to understand your device's actual power consumption for optimizing battery life:

### Online Power Profiler for LTE

For quick estimates and profiling of current consumption based on network and transmission parameters, use the [Online Power Profiler for LTE](https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/power/w/opp/3/online-power-profiler-for-lte).

### Power Profiler Kit 2 (PPK2)

For accurate measurements and detailed profiling, use the [PPK2: Power Profiler Kit 2](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/Power-Profiler-Kit-2) and for detailed guidance on how to use the PPK2, see the [Power Profiler Kit User Guide](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ug_ppk2/page/UG/ppk/PPK_user_guide_Intro.html).

## Application power configuration

The Asset Tracker Template is configured with power-saving features enabled by default. This section covers the key configuration options specific to the application.

For general configuration of the LTE link, refer to the [LTE Link Control documentation](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ncs-latest/page/nrf/libraries/modem/lte_lc.html).

### Power Saving Mode (PSM)

PSM is **enabled by default**. Configure TAU and RAT parameters in `prj.conf`:

```config
CONFIG_LTE_PSM_REQ_RPTAU_SECONDS=7200  # Periodic TAU: 2 hours
CONFIG_LTE_PSM_REQ_RAT_SECONDS=6       # Active Time: 6 seconds
```

It is recommended to configure a periodic TAU timer longer than the update cycle (`sampling interval` * `storage threshold`) of the application to avoid synchronization with the
network between uploads.

See the [Configuration guide - PSM](configuration.md#power-saving-mode-psm) for additional options. The actual values are negotiated with the network.

### Extended Discontinuous Reception (eDRX)

eDRX is **enabled by default**. Configure the eDRX interval in `prj.conf`:

```config
CONFIG_LTE_EDRX_REQ_VALUE_LTE_M="0000"  # eDRX interval 5.12 s for LTE-M
CONFIG_LTE_EDRX_REQ_VALUE_NBIOT="0000"  # eDRX interval 5.12 s for NB-IoT
```

eDRX is used to periodically sleep during the PSM active timer. With the default settings, the device monitors for downlink data every 5.12 seconds for the duration of the active timer (6 seconds by default) in case the cloud sends data to the device.

### Sampling and send behavior

The following Kconfig options set in the `prj.conf` file control sampling and
transmission frequency:

```config
CONFIG_APP_SAMPLING_INTERVAL_SECONDS=600      # Default: 10 minutes
CONFIG_APP_STORAGE_INITIAL_THRESHOLD=1        # Default: 1 item
```

Sensors and location are sampled and stored at the interval set by the
`CONFIG_APP_SAMPLING_INTERVAL_SECONDS` Kconfig option. Buffered data is sent to the cloud
when the number of stored items reaches
`CONFIG_APP_STORAGE_INITIAL_THRESHOLD`.

You can adjust these values at runtime using the nRF Cloud device shadow. See
the [Configuration guide](configuration.md#runtime-configurations) for
details.

**Impact:** Using longer intervals between operations and increasing the storage threshold results in fewer network connections and leads to lower power consumption.

Ensure that the PSM Periodic TAU interval is set reasonably longer than the
expected cloud upload cadence (`sampling interval` * `storage threshold`) to avoid waking the modem up too often for
network maintenance.

### UART power management

UART interfaces consume power even when idle. The application provides options to disable UART at runtime to reduce power consumption.

#### Automatic UART disable on Thingy:91 X

The Thingy:91 X can automatically disable UART when the USB cable is disconnected. Enable in `prj.conf`:

```config
CONFIG_APP_UART_POWER_CONTROL=y
```

When enabled, the device monitors VBUS and automatically suspends UART interfaces when USB power is removed. This is useful for development where you need UART logging during USB connection but want to minimize power consumption when running on battery. See the [UART Power Control module](../modules/uart_power_control.md) for details.

#### Manual UART control using shell

UART devices can be manually suspended at runtime using shell commands:

```bash
uart:~$ pm suspend uart@9000  # Suspend UART0
uart:~$ pm suspend uart@8000  # Suspend UART1
```

> [!NOTE]
> After suspending the UART you are using for the shell, you will not be able to send further commands until the device is reset or the UART is resumed through other means.

### Wi-Fi scanning optimization (Thingy:91 X using the nRF7002)

On the Thingy:91 X, Wi-Fi® scanning is used for location services. A full Wi-Fi scan across all bands can take 5-10 seconds, which consumes significant power. To reduce scan time and power consumption, the application restricts scanning to the 2.4 GHz band by default.

For detailed information on Wi-Fi scan timing, channels, and dwell times, see the [Wi-Fi scan operation documentation](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ncs-latest/page/nrf/protocols/wifi/scan_mode/scan_operation.html).

#### 2.4 GHz band scanning (default)

The application sets `CONFIG_NRF_WIFI_2G_BAND` by default to restrict Wi-Fi scanning to the 2.4 GHz band. This is a deliberate optimization for location services:

- **Most commercial APs and hotspots use channels 1, 6, and 11**, the standard non-overlapping 2.4 GHz channels. Scanning the 2.4 GHz band provides sufficient AP coverage for location services in the vast majority of applications.
- **Active scanning is used by default**, which is preferred for moving devices. Since the device might not stay in range of an AP for long, active scanning (which sends probe requests and receives probe responses) discovers APs significantly faster than passive scanning (which waits for beacons).

If your use case requires 5 GHz AP coverage, remove `CONFIG_NRF_WIFI_2G_BAND=y` from the board configuration file (for example, `boards/thingy91x_nrf9151_ns.conf`).

## Optimization best practices

1. **Disable peripherals** - Disable UART and peripherals that consume a lot of power.
2. **Increase sampling interval** - Reduce sampling frequency.
3. **Increase storage threshold** - Store more data before sending to cloud.
4. **Minimize payload size** - Reduce transmission duration by using effective serialization formats (CBOR, Protobuf).
5. **Validate with PPK2** - Measure actual power consumption.
