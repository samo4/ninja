# Firmware updates (FOTA)

This guide covers how to perform Firmware Over The Air (FOTA) updates using nRF Cloud, including both the web UI and REST API methods.

## Firmware versioning

The following sections cover the principles and practices used to define, manage, and maintain firmware versioning.

### Version components

Firmware versions are defined in the `app/VERSION` file:

- **VERSION_MAJOR**: Major version
- **VERSION_MINOR**: Minor version
- **PATCHLEVEL**: Patch level
- **VERSION_TWEAK**: Additional component (typically 0)
- **EXTRAVERSION**: Extra string (for example, "dev", "rc1")

Example resulting in version `1.2.3-dev`:

```plaintext
VERSION_MAJOR = 1
VERSION_MINOR = 2
PATCHLEVEL = 3
VERSION_TWEAK = 0
EXTRAVERSION = dev
```

### Preparing firmware

Complete the following steps when preparing **application** or **bootloader** firmware. Modem firmware bundles are already available in nRF Cloud, skip to **Create a FOTA Update** below and select a modem bundle from the dropdown.

1. Update the `app/VERSION` file. Increment the appropriate version component.
1. Build the firmware.

    Using the command line:

    ```bash
    west build -p -b thingy91x/nrf9151/ns # Build for the appropriate board
    ```

    Or use the nRF Connect for VS Code. See the [Getting Started](getting_started.md) guide for details on building with the extension.

1. Locate update bundles in the output directory (`app/build/`):

    - `build/dfu_application.zip` - Application firmware update
    - `build/dfu_mcuboot.zip` - Bootloader update

### Version verification

To verify a successful update:

- **Application updates**: Check that the FOTA job shows `Succeeded` status and the **App Version** field in device information reflects the new version.
- **Modem updates**: Check that the FOTA job shows `Succeeded` status and the **Modem Firmware** field in device information shows the new version.
- **Bootloader updates**: Check that the FOTA job shows `Succeeded` status and the **Bootloader Version** field in device information shows the new version.

## Performing FOTA updates

You can perform FOTA updates using the nRF Cloud Web UI or the REST API.

After creating and applying a FOTA job in nRF Cloud, the device checks for updates automatically on a configured interval and when triggered by user input (for example, a button press). To trigger a check manually during development, connect to the device shell and run:

```bash
att_fota poll
```

The device must be connected to the network and cloud. If a pending update is found, the FOTA module starts the download automatically.

### Option 1: nRF Cloud Web UI

This is the recommended method for manual updates and testing.

1. Navigate to [nRF Cloud](https://nrfcloud.com) and log in to your account.
1. Select **Firmware Updates** in the **Device Management** tab on the left.
1. For **application** or **bootloader** updates only, create an update bundle:

    1. Click **Add bundle**.
    1. Upload your bundle file:

        - For application updates: `dfu_application.zip`
        - For bootloader updates: `dfu_mcuboot.zip`

    1. Enter a **Name** for the bundle.
    1. Enter a **Version** string (this is only a label for the bundle list and is not used by the device).
    1. Click **Create/Upload Bundle**.

1. Create a FOTA update:

    1. Click **Create FOTA Update**.
    1. Enter a **Name** for the update.
    1. Optionally enter a **Description**.
    1. In the **Bundle** dropdown, select the target bundle:

        - For application or bootloader updates: the bundle you uploaded in the previous step.
        - For modem updates: a pre-provisioned **full** or **delta** modem bundle already listed in nRF Cloud.

    1. Select the target device or devices using one of the following fields:

        - **Group** — deploys to every device in a predefined device group.
        - **Devices** — pick individual devices by clicking their device UUID to add them to the selection.

    1. Check **Deploy now** to start the update immediately after creation. Leave it unchecked to create the job and deploy it manually later.
    1. Click **Create FOTA Update** to create the update.

1. Monitor progress:

    - The **Overall Progress** section transitions from **In Progress** to **Completed**.
    - The individual device **Status** progresses through **Queued → Updating → Succeeded**.
    - The device automatically downloads and applies the update once it comes online.
    - To trigger an immediate FOTA poll, press and hold **Button 1** on the device. On **Thingy:91 X**, pressing on the top of the case pushes Button 1.

1. Verify the update:

    1. Navigate to your device page.
    1. Click **Devices** under **Device Management** in the navigation pane on the left, then click the device UUID in the list to open the device page.
    1. Click **Device info** under the **Device Information** card.
    1. Check the **App Version** (for app updates) or **Modem Firmware** (for modem updates) field.
    1. Confirm that the version matches your new firmware.

### Option 2: REST API

For automated workflows and CI/CD integration, use the REST API.

#### Setup

```bash
export API_KEY=<your-nrf-cloud-api-key>
export DEVICE_ID=<your-device-id>
```

Find your API key in **User Account** settings in [nRF Cloud](https://nrfcloud.com/). See [nRF Cloud REST API](https://api.nrfcloud.com/) for reference.

#### Complete update workflow

1. Create manifest and upload bundle:

    ```bash
    # Set path to your application binary
    export BIN_FILE="build/app/zephyr/zephyr.signed.bin"
    export FW_VERSION="1.2.3"

    # Create manifest.json with firmware details
    cat > manifest.json << EOF
    {
        "name": "My Firmware",
        "description": "Firmware description",
        "fwversion": "${FW_VERSION}",
        "format-version": 1,
        "files": [
            {
                "file": "$(basename ${BIN_FILE})",
                "type": "application",
                "size": $(stat -c%s ${BIN_FILE} 2>/dev/null || stat -f%z ${BIN_FILE})
            }
        ]
    }
    EOF

    # Create zip containing firmware and manifest
    zip -j firmware.zip ${BIN_FILE} manifest.json

    # Upload to nRF Cloud and extract bundle ID
    UPLOAD_RESPONSE=$(curl -X POST "https://api.nrfcloud.com/v1/firmwares" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_KEY}" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/zip" \
      --data-binary @firmware.zip)

    # Extract the bundle ID from the response (UUID from the URI path)
    export BUNDLE_ID=$(echo $UPLOAD_RESPONSE | jq -r '.uris[0]' | grep -oE '[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}')
    ```

1. Create and apply FOTA job:

    ```bash
    # Create job
    JOB_RESPONSE=$(curl -X POST "https://api.nrfcloud.com/v1/fota-jobs" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_KEY}" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d "{\"deviceIds\": [\"${DEVICE_ID}\"], \"bundleId\": \"${BUNDLE_ID}\"}")

    export JOB_ID=$(echo $JOB_RESPONSE | jq -r '.jobId')

    # Apply job
    curl -X POST "https://api.nrfcloud.com/v1/fota-jobs/${JOB_ID}/apply" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_KEY}"
    ```

1. Monitor job status:

    ```bash
    curl -X GET "https://api.nrfcloud.com/v1/fota-jobs/${JOB_ID}" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_KEY}" \
      -H "Accept: application/json"
    ```

    Job status values: `QUEUED`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `DOWNLOADING`, `SUCCEEDED`, `FAILED`, `TIMED_OUT`, `CANCELLED`, `REJECTED`

1. Verify the update by checking the device information in [nRF Cloud](https://nrfcloud.com/) (**App Version** or **Modem Firmware** field).
