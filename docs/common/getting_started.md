# Getting started

This guide walks you through getting the Asset Tracker Template running end-to-end on supported hardware. It covers:

* Setting up the development environment
* Building the application
* Flashing the application to the device
* Connecting the device to [nRF Cloud](https://nrfcloud.com)

There are two options for setting up the project, depending on your preferred development environment:

* **Option 1**: Using Visual Studio Code and the [nRF Connect for VS Code](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/nrf-connect-vscode/page/index.html) extension (recommended).
* **Option 2**: Using the command line and nRF Util.

For pre-built binaries that do not require a build environment, refer to the latest tag and the [release artifacts](release.md) documentation.

## Option 1: nRF Connect for VS Code (recommended)

1. Open the **nRF Connect** extension panel from the VS Code activity bar.

1. Under the **Welcome** section of the extension panel, click **Create a new application**:

    ![nRF Connect extension panel with Create a new application](../images/create_new_app.png)

1. In the application picker, select the **Browse nRF Connect SDK add-on Index** option and search for **Asset Tracker Template**:

    ![Asset Tracker Template add-on](../images/addon_att.png)

1. After the project is created, it is listed under **Applications** in the extension panel. Click **Add build configuration** under the **app** entry (or use the **Add build configuration** button under **Build**) to open the build configuration dialog.

1. In the **Add build configuration (app)** dialog, set the **Board target**. With the **Compatible** filter selected (the default), only the supported build targets are listed:

    | Board        | Board target            |
    | ------------ | ----------------------- |
    | Thingy:91 X  | `thingy91x/nrf9151/ns`  |
    | nRF9151 DK   | `nrf9151dk/nrf9151/ns`  |

    Keep the other fields at their defaults and click **Generate and build** to build the application.

1. Flash the device

    Expand the section that matches your hardware setup.

    <details markdown="1">
    <summary><strong>Thingy:91 X (with debugger) or nRF9151 DK</strong></summary>

    With an external J-Link debugger attached to the Thingy:91 X, click the **Erase and flash to board** icon next to **Flash** in the **Actions** panel.

    Do not use the simple **Flash** action. It will fail with a UICR-related error.

    If prompted for which device to flash, select the ID of the debugger or nRF9151 DK. Do not select the `THINGY91X_(serial number)` device, as it is not used with an external debugger.
    </details>

    <details markdown="1">
    <summary><strong>Thingy:91 X (no debugger)</strong></summary>

    Thingy:91 X does not have an on-board debugger, so the default **Flash** action in the **Actions** panel will not work. Flash over the serial bootloader from a toolchain terminal instead.

    To open a toolchain terminal, right-click the **app** entry under **Applications** and select **Start new terminal**. This opens a shell with all the nRF Connect SDK tools available. Then run:

    ```shell
    west thingy91x-dfu
    ```

    </details>

1. After flashing, open a serial terminal at 115200 baud to view the device logs. The [Serial Terminal app](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nRF-Connect-for-Desktop) (part of nRF Connect for Desktop) is recommended; PuTTY, Tera Term, and minicom also work.

1. Follow the instructions in [Connecting](connecting.md) to connect the device to nRF Cloud.

For more details on how to use nRF Connect for VS Code, refer to the [nRF Connect for VS Code documentation](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/nrf-connect-vscode/page/index.html).

## Option 2: Command line

### Install prerequisites

1. Install nRF Util by following the instructions in the [nRF Util documentation](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/nrfutil/page/guides/installing.html).

1. Install the SDK manager command:

    ```bash
    nrfutil install sdk-manager
    ```

1. Install the nRF Connect SDK toolchain (v3.4.0 or later):

    ```bash
    nrfutil sdk-manager install v3.4.0
    ```

### Initialize the workspace

Before initializing, start the toolchain environment:

```shell
nrfutil sdk-manager toolchain launch --ncs-version v3.4.0 --shell
```

You can also run a single command within a specific nRF Connect SDK toolchain. For example:

```shell
nrfutil sdk-manager toolchain launch --ncs-version v3.4.0 -- <your command>
```

This form is useful for running, for instance, a single `west` command with a specific toolchain. You can create an alias or shell function for this command to avoid typing it in full every time.

In this document, the `nrfutil sdk-manager toolchain launch --shell` variant is used to launch the toolchain environment in the shell.

To initialize the workspace folder (`asset-tracker-template`) where the firmware project and all nRF Connect SDK modules will be cloned, run the following commands:

```shell
# Initialize asset-tracker-template workspace
west init -m https://github.com/nrfconnect/Asset-Tracker-Template.git --mr main asset-tracker-template

cd asset-tracker-template

# Update nRF Connect SDK modules. This may take a while.
west update
```

The template repository is now cloned into the `asset-tracker-template` folder, the west modules are downloaded, and you are ready to build the project.

### Build the application

1. Navigate to the application folder:

    ```shell
    # Assuming you are in the asset-tracker-template folder
    cd project/app
    ```

1. Build the application by passing the corresponding build target to `west build`:

    ```shell
    # Thingy:91 X
    west build -p -b thingy91x/nrf9151/ns

    # nRF9151 DK
    west build -p -b nrf9151dk/nrf9151/ns
    ```

### Flash the device

Expand the section that matches your hardware setup.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><strong>Thingy:91 X (with debugger) or nRF9151 DK</strong></summary>

With an external J-Link debugger attached to the Thingy:91 X, flash with:

```shell
west flash --erase
```

The `--erase` option performs a full chip erase (including UICR) before programming. Without it, `west flash` fails with a UICR-related error when the new firmware writes different UICR contents.

By default, `west flash` after a sysbuild programs each bootloader and application image separately. That is equivalent to programming `build/merged.hex`, which combines the same images into one file. To flash the merged image in a single step (for example after changing partition layout), use:

```shell
west flash --erase --skip-rebuild --hex-file build/merged.hex
```

Release builds publish the same merged image as `asset-tracker-template-{VERSION}-<board>-nrf91.hex` (see [release artifacts](release.md)).

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><strong>Thingy:91 X (no debugger)</strong></summary>

Thingy:91 X does not have an on-board debugger. Flash over the serial bootloader using one of the following alternatives.

**Alternative 1 (recommended) — `west thingy91x-dfu`:** auto-discovers the device and flashes `build/dfu_application.zip`.

```shell
west thingy91x-dfu
```

**Alternative 2 — `nrfutil device program`:** requires the Thingy:91 X serial number. Find it with `nrfutil device list` by locating the entry with **Product: `Thingy:91 X UART`** and the **`mcuBoot`** trait:

```shell
nrfutil device list
```

```
851006699
Product         J-Link
Traits          usb, jlink, seggerUsb

THINGY91X_ED0E7655C09       <-- this is the Thingy:91 X serial number
Product         Thingy:91 X UART
Ports           /dev/tty.usbmodem142102, vcom: 0
                /dev/tty.usbmodem142105, vcom: 1
Traits          mcuBoot, modem, serialPorts, nordicUsb, usb
```

Then flash, replacing `<serial-number>` with the identifier from the previous command (for example `THINGY91X_ED0E7655C09`):

```shell
nrfutil device program --firmware build/dfu_application.zip \
    --serial-number <serial-number> --traits mcuboot \
    --x-family nrf91 --core Application
```

To reset the Thingy:91 X from the terminal without re-flashing (equivalent to pressing the reset button), run:

```shell
west thingy91x-reset
```

</details>

The application is now built and flashed to the device. Open a serial terminal at 115200 baud to view the logs. The [Serial Terminal app](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nRF-Connect-for-Desktop) (part of nRF Connect for Desktop) is recommended; PuTTY, Tera Term, and minicom also work.

**Next step:** Continue to [Connecting](connecting.md) to claim and provision the device on nRF Cloud.

## Testing

To test that everything is working as expected, complete the following steps:

1. In a web browser, navigate to [nRF Cloud](https://nrfcloud.com) and log in to your account. Navigate to the **Device management** menu and select **Devices**. You should now see your device listed in the device overview. Click on the device ID to see the device page.

    ![nRF Cloud device management menu](../images/nrfcloud_devices.png)

1. After provisioning, the device should already be connected and sending data. In the web browser, you will see the device page update with the latest information from the device, including the location, battery level, and other sensor data.

    ![nRF Cloud example data](../images/nrf_cloud_example_data.png)

1. Press and hold **Button 1** on the device to trigger an immediate cloud sync, including sending buffered data, polling for FOTA updates, and fetching configuration changes. On **Thingy:91 X**, pressing on the top of the case pushes Button 1.

    > **Note:** The device samples and sends data at configurable intervals. Between intervals, the device is in a low-power state. Pressing and holding the button forces an immediate cloud update cycle.

1. Optionally, you can reset the device to observe the full boot and connection sequence. Connect to the device using the serial terminal and reset the device using the following shell command:

    ```shell
    kernel reboot
    ```

1. In the serial terminal, you will see the device booting up, connecting to the network, and establishing a connection to nRF Cloud using the provisioned credentials.

If you experience issues, check the logs in the serial terminal for any error messages. You can find troubleshooting tips in the [Troubleshooting](tooling_troubleshooting.md) section of the documentation.
You can also open a support ticket on [DevZone](https://devzone.nordicsemi.com) for further assistance.

## Next steps

Now that you have the application running, you can explore the following areas:

* **Explore the architecture** - Understand how the modular, event-driven system works in the [Architecture](architecture.md) guide. This is a good starting point if you want to understand the design decisions and how modules interact.
* **Configure the application** - Adjust sampling intervals, cloud sync frequency, location method priorities, and other runtime behavior using the [Configuration](configuration.md) guide. You can change the configuration both locally and remotely through the device shadow on nRF Cloud.
* **Modify the template** - Add new sensors, create custom modules, add new zbus events, or enable MQTT support following the [Modifying the template](modifying.md) guide.
* **Perform firmware updates** - Deploy new firmware versions over-the-air using the [Firmware Updates (FOTA)](fota.md) guide. FOTA supports both application and modem firmware updates through nRF Cloud.
* **Optimize power consumption** - Learn about the power-saving features and how to achieve the lowest power consumption for your use case in the [Low Power](low_power.md) guide.
* **Set up location services** - Configure GNSS, Wi-Fi, and cellular positioning methods and their fallback priorities in the [Location Services](location_services.md) guide.
* **Set up testing and CI** - Run tests on real hardware or emulated targets, and integrate with CI pipelines as described in the [Testing and CI Setup](test_and_ci_setup.md) guide.
* **Troubleshoot issues** - Use shell commands, debugging tools, Memfault integration, and modem tracing as described in the [Tooling and Troubleshooting](tooling_troubleshooting.md) guide.
